* About

Klausies is a program used to submit "listens" (or "scrobbles") to various
music logging services, such as [[https://listenbrainz.org][ListenBrainz]] or [[https://last.fm][Last.FM]].

** Supported Services
   - [X] ListenBrainz
   - [ ] Last.FM
   - [ ] Libre.FM

* Usage
1. Follow the appropriate instructions to install Klausies by visiting our wiki.

2. On first startup, Klausies creates an empty config file at
   =$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/klausies/config.toml= (this is usually
   =~/.config/klausies/config.toml=). Please edit it with your ListenBrainz
   and/or Last.FM token.

3. If installed as a Systemd unit, run =systemctl --user enable --now klausies=.
   If not, run =klausies --daemon= and close your terminal.

4. Listen to some music and if everything is correct, you should see your
   listens being submitted to the appropriate services :)
